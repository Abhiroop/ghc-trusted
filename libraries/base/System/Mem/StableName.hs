-- Stable names are a way of performing fast (O(1)), not-quite-exact
-- comparison between objects.
--
-- Stable names solve the following problem: suppose you want to build
-- a hash table with Haskell objects as keys, but you want to use
-- pointer equality for comparison; maybe because the keys are large
-- and hashing would be slow, or perhaps because the keys are infinite
-- in size.  We can\'t build a hash table using the address of the
-- object as the key, because objects get moved around by the garbage
-- collector, meaning a re-hash would be necessary after every garbage
-- collection.
