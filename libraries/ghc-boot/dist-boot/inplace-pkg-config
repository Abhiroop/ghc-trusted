synopsis:             Shared functionality between GHC and its boot libraries
description:
    This library is shared between GHC, ghc-pkg, and other boot
    libraries.

    A note about "GHC.PackageDb": it only deals with the subset of
    the package database that the compiler cares about: modules
    paths etc and not package metadata like description, authors
    etc. It is thus not a library interface to ghc-pkg and is *not*
    suitable for modifying GHC package databases.

    The package database format and this library are constructed in
    such a way that while ghc-pkg depends on Cabal, the GHC library
    and program do not have to depend on Cabal.
