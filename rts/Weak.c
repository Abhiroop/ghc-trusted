   Incrementally running C finalizers

   The GC detects all the dead finalizers, but we don't want to run
   them during the GC because that increases the time that the runtime
   is paused.

   What options are there?

   1. Parallelise running the C finalizers across the GC threads
      - doesn't solve the pause problem, just reduces it (maybe by a lot)

   2. Make a Haskell thread to run the C finalizers, like we do for
      Haskell finalizers.
      + scheduling is handled for us
      - no guarantee that we'll process finalizers in a timely manner

   3. Run finalizers when any capability is idle.
      + reduces pause to 0
      - requires scheduler modifications
      - if the runtime is busy, finalizers wait until the next GC

   4. like (3), but also run finalizers incrementally between GCs.
      - reduces the delay to run finalizers compared with (3)

   For now we do (3). It would be easy to do (4) later by adding a
   call to doIdleGCWork() in the scheduler loop, but I haven't found
   that necessary so far.
